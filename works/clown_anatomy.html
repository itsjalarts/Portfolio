                I wanted to create a mascot that would be associated with 
                my art and brand.  I wanted her to represent me as a person 
                as well as the type of art that I create and share.

            <p>
                In college, I quickly drew up a thank you sticker with 
                the intention of the design being my mascot.  There wasn't 
                a proper design process when creating it, though I knew at 
                the time I had a few ideas that I knew I wanted to include 
                such as the double buns and bells.  I also knew I wanted my 
                color pallette to include blue as the main color.
