                Lacked consistency and a marketing strategy as an artist and wanted to create own brand identity.

            <p>
                Design and created logos and mascot to stand out from other artists and increase engagement.

                I wanted my branding to show parts of my authentic self so customers and clients can see who I am both as a person and an artist.  I built a color pallete around the color blue, as it is a color I associate with myself often.  The fonts I created are of my own handwritting.
                <br><br>
                When designing my macot, I also wanted to represent myself as well at the type of art that I want to create.  I enjoy drawing cute illustrations, so I drew my mascot stylized and cartoony to represent that.  I gave her slightly exaggerated features to give off a silly and fun vibe, trying to convey that my art is created with the intent of being bright and for everyone.

        <div class="center desc">
                <p>
                My mascot didn't change much from the first iteration to what she is now.  Initially, she was designed with more influence from clowns.  She was quickly designed for a thank you sticker for an art event and I went back and redesigned her, giving her a full body character sheet.  I decided to remove the face makeup to make it simpler and not so cluttered.
