                The digital mixed media class was a class that encouraged
                using both traditional and digital mediums simultaniously. 
                This project had 2 parts: first creating wet textures and
                then create an illustration, incorporating the textures I created.

             I started the illustration portion off by doing some quick thumbnails of 
             playing in the rain, riding in an umberlla at sea, and a waterfall 
             scene.  I chose a waterfall scene as it was what I was interested 
             in the most and wanted to work on a background piece.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few months later, I went back and did some slight revisions.
                  I added more grass in front of the 
                character, edited the rocks to get smaller as it goes up, as 
                added a slight gradient to the rocks and waterfall to make it brighter
                at the bottom.  I added more strokes to the water to add more movement
                and changed out the texture on the raincoat to make it stand out more.
