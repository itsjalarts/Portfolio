            For this project, we were assigned to illustrate 3 cohesive pieces.  The subject
            matter could be of our choice and I decided to create 3 world building illustrations 
            based off a previous project where I created a 2D platformer game.  I wanted to expand 
            on the world building and create a more in depth story for it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The story for my game is the main character wakes up with no memory and she explores the world,
            collecting crystal pieces that stories of the place she woke up in.  While exploring, the MC finds
            pieces of skeletons of the giants that once walked the planet as well as buildings and ruins guarded 
            by golems.  In this world building project, I wanted to explore places where these skeletons and ruins 
            would be and how the world surrounding it would look like.  
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a project I am planning on revisiting.  I would like to rework the existing illustrations 
            I have as well as create more pieces showcasing the world and character more.
